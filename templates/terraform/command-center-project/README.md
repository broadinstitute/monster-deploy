# Command-Center Project

This module will initialize all the infrastructure needed
to run a "command center" Monster project. So far, this includes:
1. Networks to run compute
2. A GKE cluster with a single node pool, attached to the network
3. A DNS zone for apps/services running within the GKE cluster
